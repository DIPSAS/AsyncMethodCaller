**AsyncMethodCaller** is used to call methods asynchronously. Execution will continue with other methods after the asynchronous call completes. Use this if you cannot use async and await to easily make testable asynchronous calls. Very useful in ViewModels.

See [this blog post for more information](http://hjerpbakk.com/blog/2013/10/1/async-method-caller-easy-async-without-await.html).

Also available as a [nuget-package](https://nuget.org/packages/AsyncMethodCaller).
